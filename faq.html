            <h3>1. What types of coffee do you offer?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>We offer a diverse range of coffee types, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Espresso:</strong> A concentrated coffee brewed by
                  forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Americano:</strong> Espresso mixed with hot water for
                  a milder flavor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Latte:</strong> Espresso combined with steamed milk
                  and a small amount of milk foam.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cappuccino:</strong> Similar to a latte but with more
                  foam and a sprinkle of cocoa powder.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cold Brew:</strong> Coffee brewed with cold water for
                  an extended period, resulting in a smooth flavor.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Flavored Coffee:</strong> A variety of coffee blends
                  infused with flavors such as vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>2. How should I store my coffee beans?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                To maintain the freshness and flavor of your coffee beans, it's
                essential to store them properly. Keep the beans in an airtight
                container to protect them from moisture and air, which can cause
                oxidation and loss of flavor. Store the container in a cool,
                dark place, away from heat and sunlight, which can degrade the
                beans' quality over time. Avoid storing coffee in the fridge or
                freezer, as the fluctuating temperatures and moisture can
                negatively affect the beans. Instead, aim to use the beans
                within a few weeks of opening for the best taste.

            <h3>
              3. What grind size should I use for different brewing methods?
            </h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                The grind size of your coffee plays a significant role in
                determining the flavor and extraction of your brew. Here’s a
                quick guide:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Coarse grind:</strong> Ideal for French press and cold
                  brew, as the larger grounds allow for slow extraction over a
                  longer period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Medium grind:</strong> Best for drip coffee makers,
                  pour-over methods, and Aeropress (with a shorter brew time).
                  This grind size strikes a balance between quick extraction and
                  a flavorful brew.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Fine grind:</strong> Suitable for espresso machines,
                  as the smaller particles allow for quick extraction under
                  pressure. This grind creates a strong, concentrated shot of
                  coffee.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Extra fine grind:</strong> Typically used for Turkish
                  coffee, where the grounds are almost powder-like to produce a
                  thick, bold brew.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>4. How long do coffee beans stay fresh?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Coffee beans are at their freshest within 2-4 weeks of roasting.
                After this period, they may begin to lose their aromatic oils
                and flavors. Once you open a bag of coffee beans, it’s best to
                consume them within a month for the richest taste. To maximize
                freshness, store the beans in an airtight container away from
                light, air, and moisture. Ground coffee loses freshness even
                faster, so it's recommended to grind your beans just before
                brewing.
              </p>

            <h3>5. Do you offer subscriptions for coffee deliveries?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Yes, we provide subscription options for coffee lovers who want
                to receive their favorite blends regularly. You can choose your
                preferred frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) and
                customize your selection to ensure you never run out of coffee.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>6. What are the health benefits of coffee?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Moderate coffee consumption can offer several health benefits,
                including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Improved Mental Alertness:</strong> Caffeine can
                  enhance focus and concentration.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Rich in Antioxidants:</strong> Coffee contains
                  antioxidants, which can help combat free radicals in the body.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reduced Risk of Certain Diseases:</strong> Studies
                  suggest that coffee drinkers may have a lower risk of certain
                  conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, type 2 diabetes, and
                  some types of cancer.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>7. Do you have a return policy?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Yes, we have a customer-friendly return policy. If you are not
                satisfied with your purchase, you can return it within 30 days
                for a full refund or exchange. Please ensure that the product is
                unopened and in its original packaging for a hassle-free return
                process.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>
              8. What is the difference between espresso and regular coffee?
            </h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Espresso is brewed under high pressure with finely ground
                coffee, resulting in a more concentrated and robust flavor than
                regular drip coffee.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>9. Do you offer decaffeinated coffee?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Yes, we offer a selection of decaffeinated coffee options for
                those who enjoy the taste of coffee without the caffeine. Our
                decaf coffee is processed using methods that preserve flavor
                while removing most of the caffeine, ensuring a satisfying cup.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>10. Are your coffee products gluten-free?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Yes, all our coffee products are naturally gluten-free. However,
                cross-contamination can occur during processing, so we recommend
                checking the packaging for gluten-free certifications if you
                have severe gluten sensitivities.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>11. Can I customize my coffee order?</h3>

                products. You can choose your preferred roast level, grind size,

                types to mix. This way, you can tailor your coffee experience to
